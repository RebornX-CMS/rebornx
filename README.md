# RebornX CMS

**A modernized fork of XOOPS 2.0.5**

RebornX is a content management system (CMS) based on XOOPS Version 2.0.5 (October 8, 2003). This project aims to bring the classic XOOPS codebase into the modern era with comprehensive updates including PHP 8.2+ compatibility, modern database drivers, a new theming system, true internationalization (i18n), and a host of new features — while preserving the modular architecture that made XOOPS popular.

---

## Features

### Core Modernization
- **PHP 8.2+ Compatible** — Codebase updated to run on modern PHP versions with full type safety and removal of deprecated constructs.
- **MySQLi / PDO** — Replaced the original `mysql_*` functions with modern MySQLi and PDO (MySQLi-based) database abstraction layers for improved security, performance, and compatibility.
- **Error Handling** — Robust exception-based error handling replacing legacy PHP error mechanisms.

### Theming
- **New Theming System** — A redesigned theme architecture separating logic from presentation, supporting template inheritance and modern CSS/JS asset management.
- **Smarty Templating** — Continued use of the Smarty template engine, updated to the latest stable version for security and performance.
- **Responsive by Default** — All core themes are built with responsive design principles.

### Internationalization
- **True i18n** — Complete rewrite of the language/translation system supporting proper locale handling, pluralization, character encoding (UTF-8 everywhere), and date/number formatting.
- **Multi-Language Content** — Built-in support for serving content in multiple languages.

### Database
- **MySQLi Support** — Full MySQLi driver with prepared statements for query parameterization, eliminating SQL injection vectors. All database access uses MySQLi.
- **PDO Support** — Optional PDO abstraction (backed by the MySQLi driver) for database-agnostic operation.
- **Migration Tools** — Upgrade path from the original XOOPS 2.0.x database schema.

### Security
- **XSS Prevention** — Modern output encoding and sanitization throughout the system.
- **CSRF Protection** — Token-based cross-site request forgery protection on all forms.
- **Password Hashing** — bcrypt/argon2 password hashing replacing the original MD5-based system.
- **Session Management** — Improved session handling with secure, configurable storage backends.

## Requirements

- **Web Server:** Apache 2.4+ with `mod_rewrite`, or Nginx
- **PHP:** 8.2 or higher
- **Database:** MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB 10.3+ (MySQLi or PDO via MySQLi driver)
- **Extensions:** `mbstring`, `gd`/`imagick`, `json`, `session`, `filter`, `ctype`, `tokenizer`
- **Browser:** Modern browser with JavaScript enabled

## Installation

1. **Download** the latest release from the repository.
2. **Extract** the archive to your web server's document root (e.g., `/var/www/html/rebornx`).
3. **Create a database** and user with full privileges:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE rebornx CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
   CREATE USER 'rebornx'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON rebornx.* TO 'rebornx'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```
   > **Note:** RebornX CMS uses MySQLi exclusively. The legacy `mysql` extension is not supported.

4. **Copy** `mainfile.dist.php` to `mainfile.php` and adjust database credentials and paths.
5. **Point your browser** to `http://your-server/rebornx/install/` and follow the on-screen installer.
6. **Remove or secure** the `install/` directory after installation.

## Upgrading from XOOPS 2.0.x

1. **Back up** your existing database and files.
2. **Replace** all files with the RebornX distribution (preserving `mainfile.php` and `uploads/`).
3. **Run** the upgrade script at `http://your-server/rebornx/upgrade/`.
4. **Review** the admin panel for any configuration adjustments needed under the new system.
